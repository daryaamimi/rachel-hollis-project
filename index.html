      <h1>Rachel Hollis</h1>
      <h2>The most inspirational woman in my lifetime</h2>

      <p>
        <span class="Rachel-Hollis"> <em>Rachel Hollis</em> </span>
        is an American author, motivational speaker, and blogger. She is the
        author of three self-help books, including Girl, Wash Your Face and
        Girl, Stop Apologizing. May 14 was the day that Rise, her
        self-improvement company’s conference for women, was scheduled to begin
        in Austin, Texas. At least 100 people would attend in person, and more
        than 2,000 had registered by mid-April to join online. It would be a
        fraction of her usual crowd — nearly 50,000 people logged on for a
        virtual event in May 2020 — but would put her on track to business as
        usual.
